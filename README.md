## Requirements

In order to train our model, a GPU and CUDA is required. For inference (Testing), a CPU is sufficient. However, you need to remove +cu116 from the file `requirements.txt` and add `--gpu cpu` to the commands to run the code through the CPU     

## Environment

We built the code using Python 3.9 on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA 11.6. We provide a `Dockerfile` to run our code. Alternatively, the required packagesÂ can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

We use the [iHarmony4](https://github.com/bcmi/Image-Harmonization-Dataset-iHarmony4) dataset for training and testing. The dataset directory needs to be updated in the files `config.yaml` and `config_test_FR.yml`. 
Since the dataset contains some images with a very high resolution, we resize the HAdobe5k to not be greater than 1024 pixels on the biggest side using `./notebooks/resize_dataset`.

## Training

To train the model from scratch, we provide two different models, a CNN-based and a ViT based model. The training setting are defined in the files `models/PCTNet_CNN.py` and `models/PCTNet_ViT.py`. 
The different architecture options are listed in the config file `iharm/mconfigs/base.py` and should be changed in the model files.
To start training, simply run the shell file. 

For PCTNet_CNN:

```
runs/train_PCTNet_CNN.sh
```

For PCTNet_ViT:

```
runs/train_PCTNet_ViT.sh
```

## Testing

We provide a script to reproduce the results reported in our paper. 
Our pretrained models can be found in `pretrained_models`.
To evaluate our models simply specify `pretrain_path` in `runs/test_PCTNet.sh` and then just run:

```
runs/test_PCTNet.sh
```

To apply our method to any composite image, you can use the script `scripts/evaluate_folder.py`, which evaluates all jpg files `[filename].jpg` in a specified folder that have a corresponding mask `[filename]_mask.png` or `[filename]_mask.jpg` file. For example, to evaluate the `PCTNet_ViT.pth` model, you can run:

```
python3 scripts/evaluate_folder.py source_directory ViT_pct --weights pretrained_model/PCTNet_ViT.pth
```

## Evaluation

For further evaluation, we created a notebook `evaluation/evaluation.ipynb` which processes a csv file that contains the calculated errors for each individual file. We also provide the csv files for both our methods as well as [DCCF](https://github.com/rockeyben/DCCF) and [Harmonizer](https://github.com/ZHKKKe/Harmonizer).
